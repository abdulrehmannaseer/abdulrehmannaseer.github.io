<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Motivated Data Scientist with a strong foundation in machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision. Passionate about
advancing research in anomaly detection and multimodal learning, with published and under-review work in leading venues.
Dedicated to pursuing graduate studies to deepen theoretical understanding, contribute to impactful AI research, and develop
innovative data-driven solutions to real-world problems.

My research interests include Machine Learning and Computer Vision, with a specific focus on Topological Deep Learning, Industrial Anomaly Detection, and Multimodal Sensor Fusion. My work has been accepted at international venues such as DICTA 2025 and the IEEE Sensors Journal , and I was recognized with 1st Position in my academic cohort during my studies.
